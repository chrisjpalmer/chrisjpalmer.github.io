How to code fast
How to code well

*Learn the rules, forget the rules*

Generic parallelism in go

```go
type Result[I, O] struct {
    Input I
    Output O
    Err error
}
func[I, O] doParallel(work []I, workFunc func(input I) Result[O], workers int) []Result[O] {
    //...
}

```

Unit testing

```go
// data driven vs BDD
```
- why data driven?

Integration testing

Rancher + docker compose :)
Advantages over unit testing ?
Disadvantages over unit testing ?

Algorithmic Coding

- guaranteeing code will work by having designing a small modular system with small group of inputs and outputs (therefore trackable in your head).
- quote from that guy who was a computer scientist and worked on the quorum algorithm

Package design

- good package name
- interface which belongs to the name
- portable ( doesn't have strong dependencies )
-
